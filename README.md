I used this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/th4OBktqK1I?si=eTdjX6h1Y26LOidK).
I created a text-based slot machine game in which the user deposits an amount
of money and they are able to bet on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd lines of the slot 
machine for a certain amount of money. Each time they win they will gain money.
The aim of the game is to win as much as possible without going broke.
